Dragon Dune
===========

A game for 4 players, inspired by Avalon-Hill's Dune board game.

Formally Dragons, Usurpers, and Empires (DU&E), but the Internet hates
ampersands in your project name.

So, let’s justify this things existence. Dune is a great game, but it
has it’s drawbacks. The rules are kind of ambiguous. It can take a while
to play. It can be a little cutthroat for beginners. Actually, it can be
cutthroat for everyone. Rex attempted to iron out some of these
idiosyncrasies, but they got rid of things like binding agreements,
which seem fundamentally important to the game dune.

This is an attempt to make a resource light game in the style of Dune,
that is friendlier to beginners, easier logistically (4 players instead
of 6), with greater rule clarity, and with a strong sense of theme
(taking place in a fantasy setting).

Battle Round:
-------------

Starting with the Emperor, and the proceeding in player order, if a
player has units in the same territory another player, they shall do the
following (in the following order):

1.  The player whose turn it is is the attacking player.
2.  If the Elves are taking part in the battle, they may ask what one of
    the artifacts is that their opponent will play, or ask the size of
    the army they will send into battle. The answers to these questions
    are binding.
3.  Each player secretly records how many units they will send as an
    army into battle, and they may select one artifact to use in
    the battle. For each unit sent into battle the army receives two
    points of battle value.
4.  Players reveal the size of their armies and their artifacts selected.
5.  For each color (red and black), whomever played the lower numbered
    artifact of that color, gets that amount added to their battle value.
6.  The player with the highest battle value wins the battle. In the case
    of a tie, the attacker wins.
7.  The winner removes all units used in an army in the battle.
8.  The loser removes all tokens from the territory, regarless of wheather
    or not they took part in the battle. The loser also discards all
    artifact cards used.
9.  If a player who took part in the battle has a their opponent as
    their usurper, and has a sabotaged artifact of the same suit as the
    artifact their opponent played, then they may declare their
    treachery and automatically win the battle, taking no losses. The
    loser removes all units from the territory (even those not used in
    the battle), and discards any artifacts used in the battle.
9.  This process continues until all battles for a player are resolved.
10. Then the whole process repeats for the next player in player order.

2.  If any lone player controls three castles, or if any alliance
    controls four castles, then they have won the game.

Balancing Options:
==================

-   Give players more conscription to weaken the Goblins.
-   Take away special units or starting gold to weaken the Dwarves
-   Give players (more) special units.
-   Give players (more) gold.
-   Let a player steal artifacts. When they win a battle, they may 
    take one of your opponents artifacts (randomly chosen), which they
    may then keep or sell for its value in gold.
