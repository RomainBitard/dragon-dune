    then a Great Dragon has attacked the previous event territory. All

    break alliances.

    their maximum number of cards.
2.  For each card up for bid, one at a time:

    b)  Players, starting with the Emperor, bid on card;
    c)  The winner receives the card and pays.

Recruitment and Movement Rounds:
--------------------------------

Starting with the Emperor, and the proceeding in player order, all
players may (in the following order):

1.  Move five tokens from the players graveyard to the bank.
2.  Conscript up to 2 tokens onto any territory where they already
    have tokens. This action is free.

    other territory.
4.  Move one stack of tokens through two territories, or through four
    territories if they have access to griffins.
5.  Disband some or all of one stack of tokens.

Battle Round:
-------------

Starting with the Emperor, and the proceeding in player order,

if a player has tokens in the same territory another player,

they shall do the following (in the following order):

1.  The player whose turn it is is the attacking player.
2.  If the Elves are taking part in the battle, they may ask what one of
    the artifacts is that their opponent will play, or ask the size of
    the army they will send into battle. The answers to these questions
    are binding.
3.  Each player secretly records how many tokens they will send as an
    army into battle, and they may select one artifact to use in
    the battle.
4.  Players reveal the size of their armies and their
    artifacts selected.
5.  For each color (red and black), whomever played the lower numbered
    artifact of that color, gets that amount added to their
    armies value.
6.  The player with the highest army value wins the battle. In the case
    of a tie, the attacker wins.
7.  If a player who took part in the battle has a their opponent as
    their usurper, and has a sabotaged artifact of the same suit as the
    artifact their opponent played, then they may declare their
    treachery and automatically win the battle, taking no losses. The
    loser removes all tokens from the territory (even those not used in
    the battle), and discards any artifacts used in the battle.
8.  The winner removes any tokens used in the battle from the territory,
    and can choose to discard artifacts used in the battle.
9.  This process continues until all battles for a player are resolved.

Collection Round:
-----------------

1.  All players receive two gold.
2.  Players collect gold from any territories they control. They can
    collect two gold for every token in the territory, up to the amount
    of gold in the territory.
3.  If any lone player controls three cities, or if any alliance
    controls 4 cities, then they have won the game.
4.  If six turns have passed without a winner, then the Orcs win.
