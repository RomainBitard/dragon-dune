<h1 id="dragon-dune">Dragon Dune</h1>
<p>A game for 4 players, inspired by Avalon-Hill's Dune board game.</p>
<p>Formally Dragons, Usurpers, and Empires (DU&amp;E), but the Internet hates ampersands in your project name.</p>
<p>So, let’s justify this things existence. Dune is a great game, but it has it’s drawbacks. The rules are kind of ambiguous. It can take a while to play. It can be a little cutthroat for beginners. Actually, it can be cutthroat for everyone. Rex attempted to iron out some of these idiosyncrasies, but they got rid of things like binding agreements, which seem fundamentally important to the game dune.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to make a resource light game in the style of Dune, that is friendlier to beginners, easier logistically (4 players instead of 6), with greater rule clarity, and with a strong sense of theme (taking place in a fantasy setting).</p>
