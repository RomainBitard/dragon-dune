<h1 id="dragon-dune">Dragon Dune</h1>
<p>A game for 4 players, inspired by Avalon-Hill's Dune board game.</p>
<p>Formally Dragons, Usurpers, and Empires (DU&amp;E), but the Internet hates ampersands in your project name.</p>
<p>So, let’s justify this things existence. Dune is a great game, but it has it’s drawbacks. The rules are kind of ambiguous. It can take a while to play. It can be a little cutthroat for beginners. Actually, it can be cutthroat for everyone. Rex attempted to iron out some of these idiosyncrasies, but they got rid of things like binding agreements, which seem as fundamentally important to the game Dune.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to make a resource light game in the style of Dune, that is friendlier to beginners, easier logistically (4 players instead of 6), with greater rule clarity, and with a strong sense of theme (taking place in a fantasy setting).</p>

<h1 id="advanced-faction-powers">Advanced Faction Powers:</h1>
<p>What could be more Dune-like than having optional rules that no one can agree on. Here are additional faction powers that may add depth or help balance the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orcish Plunder: The Orcs may steal artifacts. When they win a battle, they may take one of your opponents artifacts (randomly chosen), which they may then keep or discard for a reward of 1 gold.</li>
<li>Dwarven Elite Warriors: The Dwarves are fierce warriors. They have two special units, which act as normal units in every way except that each unit counts as two units for the purpose of combat.</li>
<li>Elven Blessing: After the Elves have lost 3 units in combat, they are given the power to invoke a blessing for one battle once per turn that gives them an bonus battle point and makes it so they can not be sabotaged for that battle.</li>
<li>Goblin Initiative: The Goblins may take their turn in the Recruitment and Movement round at any time, regardless of player order.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="balancing-options">Balancing Options:</h1>
<p>An easy way to balance the game is to give a player more gold or to give them a greater reserve of units (for example, having 12 units available instead of 10). They</p>
<p>Another way balancing the game is to only require 3 castles to win the game for alliances.</p>
