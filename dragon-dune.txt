
Dragon Dune
===========

A game for 4 players inspired by Avalon-Hill's Dune board game.

This was formally called Dragons, Usurpers, and Empires (DU&E), but the
Internet hates ampersands.

So, let’s justify this thing's existence. Dune is a great game, but it
has its drawbacks. It's been out of print for 30+ years. The rules are
kind of ambiguous. It can take a while to play. It can be tough to get 6
players together. Rex attempted to iron out some of these
idiosyncrasies, but they removed things like binding agreements, which
seem fundamentally important to a political wheeling-and-dealing game
like Dune.

About This Game
---------------

This is an open-source, resource light game in the style of
Avalon-Hill's Dune board game, that is friendlier to beginners, faster,
easier logistically (4 players instead of 6), with greater rule clarity,
and a strong sense of theme.

Four factions fight to control the of the land of the Red Dragon:

-   The Dwarves, who sell their treasury of artifacts to the highest
    bidder to fund their armies.
-   The Elves, cunning and mysterious, who possess arcane magic that
    reveals future events.
-   The Goblins, who's bloodthirsty mercenaries fight for gold, even
    against their own king. Their thirst for treasure finds them with a
    trove of artifacts.
-   The Orcs, who control the wild lands of the west. They worship the
    mighty Red Dragon.

Players take turns, buying artifacts to use in battle, recruiting forces
and moving armies to collect gold and capture castles. All while a horde
of wild dragons move through the land, decimating everything that comes
before them.

Battle plans are made in secret and simultaneously revealed. Magic
artifacts are used to support your armies. Even the winner of a battle
can suffer terrible attrition.

Deals made publicly between players are magically bound, and must be
honored, if possible. This, along with the tremendous cost of battle,
adds a strong political component to the game.

Players may ally and share their advantages, but there can still be only
one winner. The first player to end a turn controlling 3 or more castles
has won the game. If there is no winner after 6 turns, then the Red
Dragon still rules the land, and it's patron, the Orcs, win the game.

What You Need to Play:
----------------------

1.  The Board
2.  Faction Unit Markers (4 factions, 10 per faction)
3.  Hidden Unit Markers (10 total)
4.  Gold Markers (approximately 60 total)
5.  Deck of Standard Playing Cards
6.  One Six-Sided Die
7.  One Troll Marker
8.  One Dragon Marker
9.  One First Player Marker

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Board:
======


Rules of Note:
--------------

1.  Territory 0• (in the middle of the board) is the Great Mountain and
    is neutral territory. Players will never battle in territory 0•.
2.  Forest territories are represented by • (such as 16•). Units in a
    forest territory are safe from dragon attack.
3.  Castle territories are represented by ★ (such as 10★). Players need
    to control 3 castles to win the game. Units in a castle are safe
    from dragon attack.
4.  A player controls a castle if they alone have at least one unit
    there. Hidden units have no effect on castle control.
5.  Players in control of 3★ or 5★ have access to griffins and receive a
    travel bonus. They may move through four territories in the movement
    round (instead of 2).
6.  Players may never have more than 10 units between on the board and
    the player's graveyard at any one time.
7.  No more than two players may have units in a castle at one time.
    Note that hidden units and the troll token do not count as units for
    the purpose of this limit.
8.  Public agreements made in the game are binding and must be carried
    out, if possible. Public agreements can only be broken if all
    parties involved terminate the agreement.
9.  Players may form alliances, but there can still be only one
    winning player. Forming an alliance grants your ally an alliance
    power. Alliances can only be formed or broken during a Great Council
    after a Red Dragon. (This is a change from Dune, which allows to
    players to share a victory.)
10. Players get one movement and one recruitment per round, unless
    another special effect allows it.
11. All players placing units in the same territory as the Troll Marker
    (3★) lose 4 units in that territory at the end of the Movement
    Round. If there are still units in the territory after the units are
    removed, then the Troll Marker is also removed.
12. Players may exchange gold at any time and for any reason, although
    players may never exchange artifacts.
13. Units taking part in a battle are worth two battle points per unit.
14. The game lasts for 6 turns.

Aces are considered Special Cards.

2.  Pay half of regular price for mercenaries in the Bidding and
    Recruitment round.
3.  Move through one additional territory with your moved units in in
    the Bidding and Recruitment round.
4.  Make your units in one territory hidden for one turn. This must be
    done as soon as the units share a territory with another
    player's units. The units come out of hiding at the the beginning of
    next turn's Recruitment and Movement round (at the same time that
    the elves choose to stay hidden or not).
5.  May be played as an artifact in battle with a value of 1.

Special Cards may also be discarded to negate certain special abilities:

1.  May be played to stop the Elves (or ally) from asking a
    battle question.
2.  May be played to stop the Orcs from surviving a Red
    Dragon encounter.
3.  May be played to stop the Goblins (or ally) from disbanding units at
    the beginning of the Movement and Recruitment round (they may still
    disband at the end of the round).
4.  May be used to stop the Dwarves from using their Queen card as a
    Sabotaged Artifact and their Jack card as a Usurper.

Note: Special Cards cannot negate another special card action. So, for
example, you could stop the elves from asking a battle question (per
their normal power), but you could not stop them from using a Special
Card to ask two battle questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How To Play:
============


Rounds:
=======

Setup:
------

1.  The board is set up. Players place their starting units.
2.  If there are any Oracles, they make their victory predictions.
3.  One player is picked at random to be the Stating Player.
4.  The Dragon Marker is placed. Roll the die and multiply the number by
    three, then roll the die again and add that amount. This is the
    starting location of the Dragon Marker.
5.  Place the Troll Marker on 3★.
6.  If any other factions are not being played, place a Troll Marker in
    place of their starting units.
7.  Each player is given the King of their faction from the deck. They
    place this card face up in front of them. This is their graveyard.
    This is the only card that has to be shown. All other cards may be
    kept secret until used.
8.  Each player is dealt one of the Queens face down. Players may look
    at them.
9.  Each player is dealt one of the Jacks face down. Players may look
    at them.
10. Each player is dealt one artifact card face down. Players may look
    at them.
11. The Goblins are given a second artifact card face down, which they
    may look at.


I. Dragon Round:
----------------

1.  A six-sided dice is rolled, and the dragon marker is moved from its
    starting position that amount through the board, in numerical order.
    The dragon goes through all territories with the same numerical
    value, so the dragon would go to both 1★ and 1 when the dragon was
    at 1.

    -   Note that the dragon marker never moves to territory 0•

2.  Any units or gold the dragon marker encounters as it moves through
    the board that are not in a castle or forest are removed form
    the game.

    -   Note that Orcs only take half losses, rounded up.

3.  When the dragon marker reaches territory 18, it will next move to
    the 1★ and 1.
4.  In the Recruitment and Movement round, players may never recruit
    units at or move units through or to a territory with the
    dragon marker.


II. Event Round:
----------------

1.  One card is revealed from the Event Deck. If it is a red card, then
    the Red Dragon appears. This card is then placed at the bottom of
    the Event Deck (not in the discard pile).

2.  If the Red Dragon has appeared, then:

    -   The Red Dragon has attacked the territory at the top of the
        event discard pile (the territory where the previous event took
        place). All units and gold in that territory are lost.
    -   If the Orcs are in the same territory as the Red Dragon, they
        may move some or all of their units at that location to any
        other location.
    -   In response to the appearance of the Red Dragon, a Great Council
        is called immediately. This is the only time players may form or
        break alliances. The Great Council continues until all players
        have passed or formed an alliance.
    -   The dragon marker does NOT go to the Red Dragons location. The
        dragon marker is only moved on the Dragon Round.

3.  Reveal another Event Card and place it place it the top of the
    discard pile.
4.  Gold is placed on that location, in the amount indicated by that
    location, unless the dragon marker is present. If the dragon marker
    is at that location, then no gold is placed this turn.


III. Bidding Round:
-------------------

The Starting Player is the first Starting Bidder.

One card is placed up for bid for each player that does not have their
maximum number of cards. For each card up for bid, one at a time.

1.  The Elves, and only the Elves, are shown the card.
2.  Players, starting with the Starting Bidder, bid on card. Note that
    players may continue to bid even if previously they had passed on
    the card.
3.  The winner receives the card and pays the Dwarves.

    -   If the Dwarves win the artifact, their payment is payed to
        the bank.
    -   If the Goblins win the artifact, they receive a second artifact
        that is not revealed to the Elves.
    -   The winner may play a Special Card to avoid paying.
    -   The ally of the Dwarves my elect (on one card per turn) not
        to pay.

4.  The whole process repeats for the next player in player order. For
    each card, the next player after the current Starting Bidder (in
    player order) becomes the next Starting Bidder.
5.  At the end of the Bidding Round, the Elves are shown the next
    event card.


IV. Recruitment and Movement Rounds:
------------------------------------

The Elves must declare if any of their units are coming out of hiding.
All non-elven hidden units come out of hiding.

Then, starting with the Starting Player, and the proceeding in player
order, all players may (in the following order):

1.  The current player may remove up to 2 units from the players
    graveyard. The first unit removed is free. The second unit removed
    costs 1 gold.

    -   The ally of the Orcs may remove an additional unit from their
        graveyard at no cost.
    -   The Orcs may remove 3 units from their graveyard at no cost.

2.  If the current player is the Goblins (or their ally) they may
    disband some or all of the units in one territory at no cost.
    Disbanded units are removed from the board, but do not go to
    the graveyard.
3.  The current player may conscript 1 units from the bank onto any
    territory where they already have a unit. This action is free.\
4.  The current player may hire Goblin mercenaries at a cost of 1 gold
    per mercenary if it is in a city, or 2 gold per mercenary if it is
    into any other territory. The payment is made directly to
    the Goblins.

    -   Goblin mercenaries may not be hired in any territory where the
        dragon marker is present.
    -   Payments made by the Goblins (and their ally) are half price\
        (rounded down).
    -   The Goblin's payment is made to the bank.
    -   The Orcs may not hire mercenaries. Instead, they my raise armies
        in Orcish territories (16, 16• , 17, 18, 1, 1★, 2, & 2•) at
        no cost.
    -   If the Orcs are allied with the Goblins then they may hire
        goblin mercenaries to any valid location at the usual rate, or
        may raise armies in the Orcish territories, but they may not
        do both.
    -   The player may play a Special Card to pay half the standard
        price, rounded up.
    -   The Elves (or a player with a Special Card) must declare if
        their units go into hiding if they now share the territory with
        another player's units.

5.  The current player may move some or all units from one location
    through two territories.

    -   Units may not move through or to any location where the dragon
        marker is present.
    -   The Orcs may move through three territories.
    -   If the player has access to griffins (if they control of 3★
        or 5★) then they may move through four territories.
    -   The player may play a Special Card to extend their movement
        range by 1 territory.
    -   The Elves (or a player with a Special Card) must declare if
        their units go into hiding if they now share the territory with
        another player's units.

6.  The current player may disband some, or all, of the units in one
    territory at the cost of one gold per token. Disbanded units are
    removed from the board, but do not go to the graveyard.
7.  Then the whole process repeats for the next player in player order.
8.  After all players have taken their turns, then each player with
    units in the same territory as the Troll Marker has 4 units removed
    from that territory. If there are still units then the Troll Marker
    is also removed.


V. Battle Round:
----------------

Starting with the Starting Player, and the proceeding in player order,
if a player has units in the same territory another player, they shall
do the following (in the following order):

1.  The player whose turn it is is the attacking player.
2.  If the Elves (or their ally) are taking part in the battle, they may
    ask what color artifact their opponent will play, or ask the size of
    the army they will send into battle. The answers to these questions
    are binding.
3.  Each player secretly records how many units they will send as an
    army into battle, and they may select one artifact to use in
    the battle. For each unit sent into battle the army receives two
    points of battle value.
4.  Players reveal the size of their armies and their artifacts
    selected. Note that players may choose not to select an Artifact to
    use in battle.
5.  For each color (red and black), whomever played the lower numbered
    artifact of that color, gets that amount added to their battle
    value. If two artifacts of the same color are played, the higher
    valued artifact is discarded, regardless of who wins the battle.

    -   If the two artifacts played are the same number and color, then
        both artifacts are destroyed.

6.  The player with the highest battle value wins the battle. In the
    case of a tie, the attacker wins.
7.  The winner removes all units used in an army in the battle.
8.  The loser removes all units from the territory, regardless of
    whether or not they took part in the battle. The loser also discards
    all artifact cards used.
9.  If a player who took part in the battle has a their opponent as
    their usurper, and has a sabotaged artifact of the same suit as the
    artifact their opponent played, then they may declare their
    treachery and automatically win the battle, taking no losses. The
    loser removes all units from the territory (even those not used in
    the battle), and discards any artifacts used in the battle. The
    winner also receives two gold.
10. This process continues until all battles for a player are resolved.
11. Then the whole process repeats for the next player in player order.


VI. Collection Round:
---------------------

1.  All players receive 1 gold.
2.  For any gold on the board, the player whom controls the territory
    the gold is in may collect two gold from the board for every unit in
    the territory, up to the amount of gold in the territory.
3.  If players wish, they may discard some or all of their artifacts.


VII. Victory Round:
-------------------

1.  The next player (in player order) after the current Starting Player
    becomes the Starting Player for the next turn.
2.  If any player controls three castles then they have won the game.
3.  If 6 turns have passed without a winner, then the Orcs win.

    -   If the Orcs are not playing, then whomever has the most
        castles wins. If there is a tie, then the tied players may fight
        with any units already present in 0• (normally a neutral
        territory), with the winner of the battle winning the game. If
        there is still winner, then the first of the tied players in
        player order is the winner.

4.  If then game has not ended, then it goes back to the Dragon Round.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional Gameplay Mechanic:
===========================

Oracles
-------

Before the game, players may decide to have have one or more Oracles. If
a player is an Oracle then they secretly record the faction that predict
to win the game, the turn they will win the game, and one castle that
they will control when they win. Neither an Oracle victory or an Orc 6th
round default victory may be predicted.

If the Oracle is correct in their prediction, then they are the winner.
If two or more Oracles have predicted the win, then the player whose
victory they predicted is the winner.

Optional Advanced Faction Powers:
=================================

What could be more Dune-like than having optional rules that no one can
agree on. Here are additional faction powers that may add depth or help
balance the game.

-   Orcish Plunder: The Orcs may steal artifacts. When they win a
    battle, they may take one of your opponents artifacts (randomly
    chosen), which they may then keep or discard for a reward of 1 gold.
-   Dwarven Elite Warriors: The Dwarves are fierce warriors. Two of
    their ten units are special units, which act as normal units in
    every way except that each unit counts as two units for the purpose
    of combat (worth 4 battle points each, instead of the 2 for
    regular units).
-   Elven Blessing: After the Elves have lost 3 units in combat, they
    are given the power to invoke a blessing for one battle once per
    turn that gives them an bonus battle point and makes it so they can
    not be sabotaged for that battle.
-   Goblin Initiative: The Goblins may take their turn in the
    Recruitment and Movement round at any time, regardless of
    player order.

Optional Advanced Special Card Actions:
=======================================

Players may discard 2 Special Cards to:

1.  Make an extra movement during the Recruitment and Movement Round.
2.  Ask one yes or no question of another player that must be
    answered honestly.
3.  Cause a chaos monster to be summoned in a battle that player is
    taking part in where an artifact with a value of 6 has been played
    by either (or both) players. The chaos monster, somewhat
    predictably, destroys all gold and units in the territory, as well
    as all artifacts used in the battle.
4.  To destroy the castle walls of one territory, causing that territory
    to no longer be safe from dragon attack on the Dragon Round. The
    player must have a unit within 1 territory of the territory to
    be affected.
5.  To control the dragons on the Dragon Round, causing them to be moved
    an amount selected by the player (between 1 and 6) instead of the
    die roll.

Balancing Options:
==================

The Goblins may be to powerful, and if this is found to be the case,
then all players should receive an additional conscription.

An easy way to balance the game is to give a player more gold or to give
them a greater reserve of units (for example, having 12 units available
instead of 10). You could dial forward or back faction abilities, unit
regeneration, unit conscription, anything. Really, it's a game. Play it
however makes you happy.
