Dragon Dune
===========

A game for 4 players, inspired by Avalon-Hill's Dune board game.

Formally Dragons, Usurpers, and Empires (DU&E), but the Internet hates
ampersands in your project name.

So, let’s justify this things existence. Dune is a great game, but it
has it’s drawbacks. The rules are kind of ambiguous. It can take a while
to play. It can be a little cutthroat for beginners. Actually, it can be
cutthroat for everyone. Rex attempted to iron out some of these
idiosyncrasies, but they got rid of things like binding agreements,
which seem as fundamentally important to the game Dune.

This is an attempt to make a resource light game in the style of Dune,
that is friendlier to beginners, easier logistically (4 players instead
of 6), with greater rule clarity, and with a strong sense of theme
(taking place in a fantasy setting).

![](art/dragon-head.png)

Dragon Round:
-------------

1.  A six-sided dice is rolled, and the dragon marker is moved from its
    starting position that amount through the board, in numerical order.
    Any units or gold the wild dragons encounter are are not in a castle
    or fortress are removed form the game. When the dragon marker
    reaches territory 18, it will next move to the 1★ and 1.
2.  The dragon marker never moves to territory 0•
3.  Note that Orcs only take half losses, rounded up.

![](art/locked-chest.png)

Event Round:
------------

1.  An event card is flipped over.
2.  Gold is placed on that location, unless the dragon marker is at
    that location. If the dragon marker is at that location, then no
    gold is placed this turn.
3.  If the event card is the same color as the games current Starting
    Player, then the Red Dragon has attacked the previous
    event territory. All units and gold in that territory are lost.
4.  If the Orcs are in the same territory as the Red Dragon, they may
    move some or all of their units at that location to any
    other location.
5.  In response to the appearance of the Red Dragon, a Great Council is
    called immediately. This is the only time players may form or
    break alliances. The Great Council continues until

![](art/card-pickup.png)

Bidding Round:
--------------

The Starting Player is the first Starting Bidder.

One card is placed up for bid for each player that does not have their
maximum number of cards. For each card up for bid, one at a time.

1.  The Elves, and only the Elves are shown the card.
2.  Players, starting with the Starting Bidder, bid on card.
3.  The winner receives the card and pays the Dwarves.

    -   If the Dwarves win the artifact, their payment is payed to
        the bank.
    -   The winner may play a Special Card to avoid paying.

4.  The whole process repeats for the next player in player order. For
    each card, the next player after the current Starting Bidder (in
    player order) becomes the next Starting Bidder.

![](art/mounted-knight.png)

Recruitment and Movement Rounds:
--------------------------------

The Elves must declare if any of their units are coming out of hiding.

Then, starting with the Starting Player, and the proceeding in player
order, all players may (in the following order):

1.  If they current player is the Goblins, they may disband some or all
    of the units in one territory.
2.  The current player may remove five units from the players graveyard.
3.  The current player may conscript 1 units from the bank onto any
    territory where they already have a unit. This action is free.
4.  The current player may hire Goblin mercenaries at a cost of 1 gold
    per mercenary if it is in a city, or 2 gold per mercenary if it is
    into any other territory. The payment is made directly to
    the Goblins.

    -   Payments made by the Goblins are half price, rounded up.
    -   Payments made by the Goblins are paid to the bank
    -   The player may play a Special Card to pay half price,
        rounded up.

5.  The current player may move some or all units from one location
    through two territories.

    -   The Orcs may move through three territories.
    -   If the player has access to griffins (If they control of 3★
        or 5★) then they may move through four territories.
    -   The player may play a Special Card to make a second movement
        this round.

    all of the units in one territory.
7.  Then the whole process repeats for the next player in player order.

![](art/crossed-swords.png)

Battle Round:
-------------

Starting with the Starting Player, and the proceeding in player order,
if a player has units in the same territory another player, they shall
do the following (in the following order):

1.  The player whose turn it is is the attacking player.
2.  If the Elves are taking part in the battle, they may ask what one of
    the artifacts is that their opponent will play, or ask the size of
    the army they will send into battle. The answers to these questions
    are binding.
3.  Each player secretly records how many units they will send as an
    army into battle, and they may select one artifact to use in
    the battle. For each unit sent into battle the army receives two
    points of battle value.
4.  Players reveal the size of their armies and their
    artifacts selected.
5.  For each color (red and black), whomever played the lower numbered
    artifact of that color, gets that amount added to their
    battle value.
6.  The player with the highest battle value wins the battle. In the
    case of a tie, the attacker wins.
7.  The winner removes all units used in an army in the battle.
8.  The loser removes all tokens from the territory, regardless of
    whether or not they took part in the battle. The loser also discards
    all artifact cards used.
9.  If a player who took part in the battle has a their opponent as
    their usurper, and has a sabotaged artifact of the same suit as the
    artifact their opponent played, then they may declare their
    treachery and automatically win the battle, taking no losses. The
    loser removes all units from the territory (even those not used in
    the battle), and discards any artifacts used in the battle.
10. This process continues until all battles for a player are resolved.
11. Then the whole process repeats for the next player in player order.

![](art/coins.png)

Collection Round:
-----------------

1.  All players receive 1 gold.
2.  Players collect gold from any territories they control. They can
    collect two gold for every unit in the territory, up to the amount
    of gold in the territory.
3.  If players wish, they may discard some or all of their artifacts.

![](art/throne-king.png)

Victory Round:
--------------

1.  The next player in player order becomes the Emperor.
2.  The next player (in player order) after the current Starting Player
    becomes the Starting Player for the next turn.
3.  If any unallied player controls three castles, or if any alliance
    controls four castles, then they have won the game.
4.  If 8 turns have passed without a winner, then the Orcs win.
5.  If then game has not ended, then it goes back to the Dragon Round.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Faction Powers:
========================

What could be more Dune-like than having optional rules that no one can
agree on. Here are additional faction powers that may add depth or help
balance the game.

-   Orcish Plunder: The Orcs may steal artifacts. When they win a
    battle, they may take one of your opponents artifacts (randomly
    chosen), which they may then keep or discard for a reward of 1 gold.
-   Dwarven Elite Warriors: The Dwarves are fierce warriors. They have
    two special units, which act as normal units in every way except
    that each unit counts as two units for the purpose of combat.
-   Elven Blessing: After the Elves have lost 3 units in combat, they
    are given the power to invoke a blessing for one battle once per
    turn that gives them an bonus battle point and makes it so they can
    not be sabotaged for that battle.
-   Goblin Initiative: The Goblins may take their turn in the
    Recruitment and Movement round at any time, regardless of
    player order.

Balancing Options:
==================

An easy way to balance the game is to give a player more gold or to give
them a greater reserve of units (for example, having 12 units available
instead of 10). They

Another way balancing the game is to only require 3 castles to win the
game for alliances.
