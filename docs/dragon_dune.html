<h1 id="dragon-dune">Dragon Dune</h1>
<p>A game for 4 players inspired by Avalon-Hill's Dune board game.</p>
<p>This was formally called Dragons, Usurpers, and Empires (DU&amp;E), but the Internet hates ampersands.</p>
<p>So, let’s justify this thing's existence. Dune is a great game, but it has its drawbacks. It's been out of print for 30+ years. The rules are kind of ambiguous. It can take a while to play. It can be tough to get 6 players together. Rex attempted to iron out some of these idiosyncrasies, but they removed things like binding agreements, which seem fundamentally important to a political wheeling-and-dealing game like Dune.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-game">About This Game</h2>
<p>This is an open-source, resource light game in the style of Avalon-Hill's Dune board game, that is friendlier to beginners, faster, easier logistically (4 players instead of 6), with greater rule clarity, and a strong sense of theme.</p>
<p>Four factions fight to control the of the land of the Red Dragon:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Dwarves, who sell their treasury of artifacts to the highest bidder to fund their armies.</li>
<li>The Elves, cunning and mysterious, who possess arcane magic that reveals future events.</li>
<li>The Goblins, who's bloodthirsty mercenaries fight for gold, even against their own king. Their thirst for treasure finds them with a trove of artifacts.</li>
<li>The Orcs, who control the wild lands of the west. They worship the mighty Red Dragon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players take turns, buying artifacts to use in battle, recruiting forces and moving armies to collect gold and capture castles. All while a horde of wild dragons move through the land, decimating everything that comes before them.</p>
<p>Battle plans are made in secret and simultaneously revealed. Magic artifacts are used to support your armies. Even the winner of a battle can suffer terrible attrition.</p>
<p>Deals made publicly between players are magically bound, and must be honored, if possible. This, along with the tremendous cost of battle, adds a strong political component to the game.</p>
<p>Players may ally and share their advantages, but there can still be only one winner. The first player to end a turn controlling 3 or more castles has won the game. If there is no winner after 6 turns, then the Red Dragon still rules the land, and it's patron, the Orcs, win the game.</p>

<h2 id="rules-of-note">Rules of Note:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Territory 0• (in the middle of the board) is the Great Mountain and is neutral territory. Players will never battle in territory 0•.</li>
<li>Forest territories are represented by • (such as 16•). Units in a forest territory are safe from dragon attack.</li>
<li>Castle territories are represented by ★ (such as 10★). Players need to control 3 castles to win the game. Units in a castle are safe from dragon attack.</li>
<li>A player controls a castle if they alone have at least one unit there. Hidden units have no effect on castle control.</li>
<li>Players in control of 3★ or 5★ have access to griffins and receive a travel bonus. They may move through four territories in the movement round (instead of 2).</li>
<li>Players may never have more than 10 units between on the board and the player's graveyard at any one time.</li>
<li>No more than two players may have units in a castle at one time. Note that hidden units and the troll token do not count as units for the purpose of this limit.</li>
<li>Public agreements made in the game are binding and must be carried out, if possible. Public agreements can only be broken if all parties involved terminate the agreement.</li>
<li>Players may form alliances, but there can still be only one winning player. Forming an alliance grants your ally an alliance power. Alliances can only be formed or broken during a Great Council after a Red Dragon. (This is a change from Dune, which allows to players to share a victory.)</li>
<li>Players get one movement and one recruitment per round, unless another special effect allows it.</li>
<li>All players placing units in the same territory as the Troll Marker (3★) lose 4 units in that territory at the end of the Movement Round. If there are still units in the territory after the units are removed, then the Troll Marker is also removed.</li>
<li>Players may exchange gold at any time and for any reason, although players may never exchange artifacts.</li>
<li>Units taking part in a battle are worth two battle points per unit.</li>
<li>The game lasts for 6 turns.</li>

<ul>
<li>Orcish Plunder: The Orcs may steal artifacts. When they win a battle, they may take one of your opponents artifacts (randomly chosen), which they may then keep or discard for a reward of 1 gold.</li>
<li>Dwarven Elite Warriors: The Dwarves are fierce warriors. Two of their ten units are special units, which act as normal units in every way except that each unit counts as two units for the purpose of combat (worth 4 battle points each, instead of the 2 for regular units).</li>
<li>Elven Blessing: After the Elves have lost 3 units in combat, they are given the power to invoke a blessing for one battle once per turn that gives them an bonus battle point and makes it so they can not be sabotaged for that battle.</li>
<li>Goblin Initiative: The Goblins may take their turn in the Recruitment and Movement round at any time, regardless of player order.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="optional-advanced-special-card-actions">Optional Advanced Special Card Actions:</h1>
<p>Players may discard 2 Special Cards to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Make an extra movement during the Recruitment and Movement Round.</li>
<li>Ask one yes or no question of another player that must be answered honestly.</li>
<li>Cause a chaos monster to be summoned in a battle that player is taking part in where an artifact with a value of 6 has been played by either (or both) players. The chaos monster, somewhat predictably, destroys all gold and units in the territory, as well as all artifacts used in the battle.</li>
<li>To destroy the castle walls of one territory, causing that territory to no longer be safe from dragon attack on the Dragon Round. The player must have a unit within 1 territory of the territory to be affected.</li>
<li>To control the dragons on the Dragon Round, causing them to be moved an amount selected by the player (between 1 and 6) instead of the die roll.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="balancing-options">Balancing Options:</h1>
<p>The Goblins may be to powerful, and if this is found to be the case, then all players should receive an additional conscription.</p>
<p>An easy way to balance the game is to give a player more gold or to give them a greater reserve of units (for example, having 12 units available instead of 10). You could dial forward or back faction abilities, unit regeneration, unit conscription, anything. Really, it's a game. Play it however makes you happy.</p>
